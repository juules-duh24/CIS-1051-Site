#### What have you done for your project so far?

Half of my project is complete, I only need to find more sources. It is no longer a continious list because that looked unpleasant

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

A few tabs are still blank but that is just finding sources and writing about them
I need to create a submission form for feedback

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Embedding external websites (so far I have only gotten twitter pages in)
Expanding the top bar/ changing margins of the css library that i am using
Submission form
A list to filter through was so ugly so I seperated into tabs on a website
